            <p>The Jasmine Dragon is a traditional tea shop in the Upper Ring of Ba Sing Se; due to its location, its clientele mostly consists of the upper class citizens of the Earth Kingdom capital. It was once a failing business but was completely revived after Iroh took over. It opened shortly after he and Zuko arrived in the city as refugees. Iroh named it the "Jasmine Dragon" because, in his words, the name was "dramatic, poetic, and [had] a nice ring to it", and also as a reminder of the very nature of life: "Where there is balance, there is peace", evocative to jasmine tea's properties.</p>
            <p>You have been recently employed at this great establishment. You will work as both the cashier and junior tea maker, and will take orders while completing them in between. Make sure every customer get their tea else you might get fired (by Zuko, not Iroh)</p>
